# 🦷 Basic Patient Booking System

A simple demo application for managing dental appointments, built with **Vite + React**. The system is designed to simulate users to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** patient appointments, with access and permissions depending on the user's role.

This project simulates a dental clinic appointment system set in **Mandaue City, Philippines**.
